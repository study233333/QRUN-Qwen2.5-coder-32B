# Model Card: Qwen2.5-Coder-32B (Hybrid Q-RUN)

## Basic Information
- Model Name: Qwen2.5-Coder-32B (Hybrid Q-RUN)
- Version: v0.1-beta
- Author/Maintainer: TheWakeSystems

## Architecture and Modifications
This model is based on Qwen2.5-Coder-32B. We replaced a subset of classical layers in the original model with Hybrid Q-RUN quantum-informed modules (8 out of 64 layers replaced) to drastically reduce parameter count and explore a quantum-classical hybrid inference pathway.

## Intended Use
- Mathematical and logical reasoning tasks (performs normally)
- Code generation, commonsense reasoning, multilingual tasks (exhibit performance degradation or token repetition)

## Limitations and Known Issues
- Code generation capabilities are degraded in the current version: token repetition, semantic breaks, or loss of context may occur.
- This version is not recommended for production environments with strict generation quality requirements.

## Training / Fine-tuning Data
This repository only contains the model implementation and inference code. Training data is not publicly distributed. Users are solely responsible for ensuring the legality and compliance of any training or fine-tuning data used.

## Ethics and Risk Statement
- Generating incorrect or unverified code can lead to security or business risks; please review generated content manually before use.
- The model may produce biased or inappropriate content. Please comply with relevant laws, regulations, and ethical standards when using it.
