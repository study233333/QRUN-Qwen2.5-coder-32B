## Highlights

- **Extreme Parameter Compression:** Reduced trainable parameters from 3398M to 43.7M (≈ 1.3%), heavily minimizing memory footprint.
- **Quantum-Classical Hybrid Layer:** Leverages proprietary Hybrid Q-RUN architecture by TheWakeSystems to replace specific transformer layers with quantum-informed modules.
- **Enterprise Multi-GPU Deployment:** Designed for 16× CUDA GPUs (BF16) with automated device mapping and memory load balancing.


## Model Overview

THeWakeSystems QRUN Hybrid-32B is a model developed based on Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, developed by TheWakeSystems. The original Qwen2.5-Coder-32B is an open-weight model designed for powerful coding, reasoning, and mathematical tasks. This version is compressed using TheWakeSystems' proprietary Hybrid Q-RUN technology, reducing parameter count and memory requirements drastically while aiming to preserve core structural capabilities.

The model is intended for constrained hardware environments requiring multi-GPU distributed inference where traditional memory footprints are prohibitive.


## Key Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Base model** | Qwen2.5-Coder-32B |
| **Target Workloads** | Mathematical reasoning, logic, code generation |
| **Parameters** | 43.7M trainable parameters after Hybrid Q-RUN compression (reduced vs. base 3398M active layers) |
| **Architecture** | Quantum-Classical Hybrid Decoder-only Transformer |
| **Compression** | Hybrid Q-RUN (proprietary quantum-informed layer replacement) |
| **Primary language** | English / Chinese |
| **Recommended Hardware** | 16× CUDA GPUs (BF16), total effective VRAM ≈ 58.8 GB |


## Quick Start

The repository provides automated scripts for standard Transformers loading and inference benchmarking.

### Environment Setup

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Inference Generation

You can load the model seamlessly using our provided `CustomQwen32B_hybrid` wrapper:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from scripts.benchmark_hybrid import load_model, generate

model_path = "/path/to/base/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B"
checkpoint_path = "checkpoints/checkpoints_hybrid_v2/epoch_2.pt"

# Initialize Tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    model_path,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    local_files_only=True,
)

# Load the Hybrid Model (Auto-dispatches to available GPUs)
model = load_model(
    checkpoint_path=checkpoint_path,
    model_path=model_path,
    device="cuda",
    dtype="bf16",
    max_memory_per_device="20GiB"
)

response = generate(model, tokenizer, "Write a Python function to compute the greatest common divisor.")
print(response)
```

For a full benchmark suite, run the integrated script:

```bash
python scripts/benchmark_hybrid.py \
    --model_path /path/to/base/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B \
    --checkpoint checkpoints/checkpoints_hybrid_v2/epoch_2.pt \
    --device cuda \
    --dtype bf16
```


## What's New in QRUN Hybrid-32B

### Summary

- **Model developed based on Qwen2.5-Coder-32B:** Inherits the strong coding and reasoning foundations.
- **Quantum-Classical Entanglement:** Uses `MonarchProj` and `EntanglementLayer` modules in place of standard MLP layers (e.g., layers 48 to 63 target replacement).
- **Automated Device Dispatch:** The inference script seamlessly charts GPU memory and distributes the hybrid model symmetrically using the `accelerate` library.


## Training & Fine-Tuning

### Base Model: Qwen2.5-Coder-32B
The base model was trained extensively on code, mathematics, and high-quality text datasets.

### Hybrid Q-RUN Compression & Knowledge Distillation
- **Compression:** TheWakeSystems' Hybrid Q-RUN architecture substitutes classical layers with quantum-informed tensor networks.
- **Fine-tuning:** The replaced layers are trained via Knowledge Distillation (KD) or standard SFT to match the original outputs, mapping massive parameter spaces into highly compact representations.
- **Training Script:** We provide `scripts/train_hybrid.py` to replicate the SFT / KD behavior, freezing the unchanged base model parameters and updating only the lightweight quantum-informed projections.


## Architecture

### Model Specifications

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Base model** | Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct |
| **Trainable parameters** | 43.7M |
| **Original target parameters** | 3398M |
| **Compression Ratio** | ≈ 1.3% |
| **Replacement Layers** | Default targets layers 48 to 63 |
| **u_proj_output_dim** | 4 |
| **block_size & entangle_rank** | 64 |


## Evaluation & Benchmarks

The benchmark script (`scripts/benchmark_hybrid.py`) evaluates the model across varying tasks: Code, Math, Logic, Commonsense, and Multilingual tasks.

Currently, due to the extreme nature of the 1.3% compression ratio, generation capabilities experience significant degradation (e.g. repeated tokens, loss of coherent reasoning). Proceed with domain-specific fine-tuning or scaling up the `entangle_rank` for production deployments.


## Languages

- **Primary languages:** English, Chinese
- **Other languages:** Supported via base model, but performance under Hybrid Q-RUN compression has not been systematically measured.


## Intended Use

### Recommended Use Cases
- Research into Quantum-Classical Hybrid Neural Networks.
- Hardware-constrained inference environment testing.
- Base architecture for extreme Knowledge Distillation experiments.

### Out-of-Scope Uses
- Production-grade code generation without further fine-tuning.
- High-risk decision-making or zero-shot critical reasoning.
- Any use that violates applicable safety laws or regulations.


## Safety & Limitations

### Known Limitations
- **Generation Quality Regressions:** Extreme compression strategies introduce task-specific degradations. The current iteration may exhibit token repetition and semantic discontinuities.
- **Model format:** Exact parity with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B is not guaranteed.

### Recommendations
- Perform task-specific evaluation prior to deployment.
- Consider adjusting the `replace_layers` count or the `entangle_rank` in `create_hybrid_model` to balance speed/memory against model accuracy.
